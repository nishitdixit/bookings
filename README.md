# bookings

In this project Firebase Phone Auth is implemented
The main objective is to track data changes in firestore database and trigger notification for specific registered user.

## Getting Started

The idea to use this feature is to make an app that can take booking from the customers and inform specific Executive to whom the customer requested.

the objective is as follows:

Implement Different Signup and Login for Executives and Customers 

For Customers - 
Once a Customers Logs in he should be able to see a list of executives.
He should be able to select one of the executive from the list and send a booking request to the executive.

For Executive - 
An executive should be able to see all the requests from different cutomers in a list.
An executive should get notification once he receives a customer request
